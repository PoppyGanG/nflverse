<!-- badges: start -->

The goal of nflverse is to attach a list of chosen 'core' packages when nflverse is loaded. It can also be used to export some additional helper functions to make them available on other machines or scripts.

More information about how to update the core list or add own functions can be found on the [personalr home page](https://mrcaseb.github.io/personalr/articles/personalr.html).

## Usage

nflverse is already installed on your machine and can be called with

``` r
library(nflverse)
```
If you make changes and want to reinstall it, please open the corresponding project and run

``` r
devtools::document()
devtools::install()
```
