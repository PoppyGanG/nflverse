## Overview

The nflverse is a set of packages dedicated to data of the National Football League. The __nflverse__ package is designed to make it easy to install and load core packages from the nflverse in a single command.

## Installation

The easiest way to get nflfastR is to install it from [GitHub](https://github.com/nflverse/nflverse/) with:

```{r eval = FALSE}
if (!require("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("nflverse/nflverse")
```

## Usage

`library(nflverse)` will load the core nflverse packages: 

* [nflfastR](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org), for play-by-play data back to 1999.
* [nflseedR](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org), for season simulations.
* [nfl4th](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org), for 4th down analysis.
